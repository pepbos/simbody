/** Class CableSpan models a cable spanning between two points with obstacles
that must be wrapped over.

TODO add description (similar to CablePath, depending on how things develop).

NOTE: The interaction with the obstacles is **ordered**. The cable can wrap over
the obstacles in the order that they are added. This means that the cable can
not wrap over the first obstacle twice, even though it might spatially intersect
it twice.

Algorithm details can be found in the following publication:

    muscle wrapping method using natural geodesic variations. Multibody System
